# lab notes for wmdd 4935

we are going to be using the exercises from several of the nodeschool.io
packages as labs for this course, you can find installation instructions and
other resources at [node school](https://nodeschool.io/)

because we are going to be covering node, a little mongodb and the hapi
framework the three tutorials that you should install are:  
- learnyounode
- make me hapi
- learnyoumongo

I would like you to do **all** of 'learnyounode' tutorials, at least the **first 10** 'make
me hapi' tutorials and **at least 5** 'learnyoumongo' tutorials. I would start
with the learnyounode tutorials.

## submission

submit solutions to problems using GitHub.
every problem solution should be in its own directory, name each directory using a 3 letter
acronym for the tutorial series and the name of the tutorial. 
ex: 'mmh_routes', 'lyn_http_client', 'lym_connect'
These should be in a single Github repository.

so your file structure should look like this:

    -- labs_wmdd4935
      -- lyn_HelloWorld
         index.js
      -- lyn_Babysteps
      -- mmh_(use mmh for make me hapi labs)
      -- lym_(learn you mongo labs)
      -- lyn_...(for every lab)

I will not be grading your labs until the end of term, but I expect you to do a
few every week. I will be checking your Github accounts and looking for progress
with the labs.

ask questions if you get stuck.

you may work with your classmates but it is important that you do the work and
understand the exercises. if you don't do the work yourself you won't be able to
pass the course exam or quizzes.

## es6 note

although the tutorials use es5 (the easiest way to spot es5 is 'var') I would
like you to primarily use es6(let, const, arrow functions...) if you need an es6
refresher nodeschool has tutorials for that.

## learn more

I encourage you to go through some of their other tutorials as well, perhaps
between semesters.
